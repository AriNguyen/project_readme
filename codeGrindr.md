# CodeGrindr - A solution for effective Hackathon team formation

## Inspiration
Finding the right teammates is a crucial step for a successful project. Therefore, we proudly present a social platform to let hackathon's goers to match, interact, and form teams. 

## What it does
The app matches the user with other teammates to create a best-matched team. Criteria for matching is to ensure a team is formed by people with different skills but necessary for a successful project.

## How we built it
We used Android Studio to build a native Java mobile app. Then create a Firebase database to draw user info. The backend code then linked to tools and methods in android studio to allow user to search and match with their potential teammates.

## Challenges we ran into
We spend half of the first day learning a new programming language that ends up not suitable for this project and had to change to another new language. The app emulator did invariably not work as we expect and be flooded with bugs and conflicts. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We learn how to properly divide responsibility, work together as a well-functioned team, and resolve problems in an effective way. From having zero experience in Java, AWS, MySQL, our team definitely acquired a lot of knowledge and skills.  

## What we learned
That all of the members haven't developed an Android app before makes it hard for develop a fully-functioning social network

## What's next for Team Forming App for Hackathons
We envision an app that allows a school class, an organization, or a collective of people from different backgrounds divides into small groups to work on any project.
